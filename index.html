                <h2>Jupiter</h2>
                <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth of that of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the Jovian or outer planets. </p>

Latest evidence by the Hubble Space Telescope shows there are three "red spots" adjacent to the Great Red Spot</figcaption>
